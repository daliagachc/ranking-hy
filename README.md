code used for the NPF ranking method manuscript

- nbs contains all the code 
- mod - functions used many times 
- figs - treated figures 
- data - data folder which is missing in this repository but can be retrieved from https://filesender.funet.fi/?s=download&token=bd42ab68-1ea5-4098-970a-da1a2c689292

in order to run all the code you might need to install the following packages:
- https://github.com/daliagachc/SciencePlots
- https://github.com/daliagachc/bnn-tools-repo
- https://github.com/daliagachc/uscit

however some of the functions used from there can also be commented out. 

## nbs logic: 

i try to follow a sequential order in the notebooks e.g z(number)(title) so that i remember the order in which the notebooks need to be ran. This is not perfect. 

## data: 

original data given to me is in ./data/data_orig

data generated with the code here is in ./data/d1
